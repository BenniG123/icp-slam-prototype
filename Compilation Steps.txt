Quick Math for HLS

35 Clock cycles @ 10 ns

Number of distance comparisons per frame
512 * 424 / 80 points per point cloud = 2,714
Number of distance comparisons per frame = 2,714 ^ 2 * 16 = 117852736

HLS Notes

With sqrtf and pow
35 cycles

without sqrtf, with pow
23 cycles

without sqrtf, multiplication only
19 cycles
"Fails" Precision test
